# 📚 Library Management System (C++)

This is a simple console-based **Library Management System** written in C++. It allows users to manage books with features like adding, displaying, searching, issuing, returning, and deleting records. All data is stored in a text file (`library.txt`) using file handling, ensuring persistence between runs. The program also includes a colored console interface and slow-print animations for a better user experience (Windows only).
